tinydtls-coap
=============

An attempt to integrate the libcoap (http://libcoap.sourceforge.net/) and tinydtls (http://tinydtls.sourceforge.net/) client-server examples.

This example is built against (modified) libcoap 4.1.1 and tinyDTLS 0.4.0. They are included as submodules, and can be built in the usual
way (`./configure` then `make`). You may receive errors about building the examples on OS X; it is safe to ignore these.

Once the submodules are built, you may build the main project.

Libcoap and tinydlts are (c)Olaf Bergmann and others.
